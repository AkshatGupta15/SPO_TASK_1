Here are some brief\ninsights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nHUL\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\n1. The first round is filling a very detailed form. This constitutes everyThing from your achievements to your life goals etc. I believe it’s to understand how actively you are engaged in progressing your career and yourself.\n\n2. Second round is basically the short listing for GD. The short listing is done on the basis of your form, your CPI, and your resume. I believe a CPI > 8.5 will suffice.\n\n3. My GD was online and it was a very quick case study. A situation was provided and 3-4 people were asked to come to a consensus for a solution. The selection over this was pretty much how any GD selection goes. You speak up, speak logically, don’t criticise, be courteous but put your point across. \n\n4. After getting selected, you have another 2 rounds of interviews. You must be very thorough with your resume. Technical questions were asked of me but not related to my coursework. Some general stuff like what motors do we use in our bot (related to a project of mine). So have at least 10 minutes of speaking content on each of your project points (yup, 10 minutes for each bullet point). Be very thorough here.\n\n5. Almost all the questions were about your resume points. So if you had written for eg something about Random Forest Classifiers, they are going to go to the depth of it. So ensure that you are able to justify all your points.They may ask very unrelated questions, that they know you don’t have the technical expertise to know. These are just to ensure you don’t get baffled by stuff. Stay calm and answer to the best of your abilities.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nI was not really preparing much for internship. I had done some GD practice with my friends, at least 3-4 mock GDs. Was doing some coding on interviewbit and some quant practice (50 challenging problems etc). I was not very rigorous in my prep. What helped me I guess, was that I had done lot of work in my semester time, Projects, Teams, Internship. All that actually helped me in the ITC shortlisting.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nI would suggest to stay calm and relaxed in interviews. A relaxed and positive vibe actually creates a big difference in such interviews. Nobody wants a nervous wreck in their company. So smile, make light conversation with the interviewers while answering their questions seriously. That shows that you are confident in dealing with new situations.\n\n",

Here are some brief\ninsights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nQuadeye (Software engineering intern), Optiver (Software engineering intern)\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nThe Graviton interview involved 2 coding questions. The first used trees and recursion, the second was quite unique and based on discrete mathematics. No questions from dynamic programming/graphs were asked. \n\nThe second round of the graviton interview involved a lot of questions from computer organisation (CS220). They asked questions based on memory management(about heap,stack, global pointer memory allocation), how the memory stack is maintained in programs(they gave an example program and asked me how the stack would be arranged), pipelining, hazards related to pipelining.\n\nThe last question was a practical one based on how cache misses and branch prediction influence performance and how to write code that keeps these points in mind. Most of the above points are covered in CS220 (other than the pratical aspects of writing code)\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n1.) For Coding practice : Interviewbit(website), Geeks for geeks(website). \n\n2.) For Algorithms theory : Introduction to algorithms by Cormen. \n\n3.) For Probability : CS203 course slides, Brainstellar(website).\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nStart preparing at the start of your summers. Try to identify which profiles are of your interest. Get your resume checked with atleast 5 seniors. If applying for high frequency trading profiles then knowledge of the market is a must. Try and be consistent. Be confident and formal during the interview.\n\n",

        "content": "\nAnanya Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do\nher summer internship in Quant profile at Quadeye. Here are some brief\ninsights of hers.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nGoldman Sachs - Summer Analyst, Uber - Software, Graviton - software, Sprinklr - Software, Microsoft -Both software and data science \n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nI gave interviews for 3 companies out of the ones I was shortlisted for. \n\n1.) Goldman Sachs:- \nI had 2 rounds, some people had to appear for 3. Both were technical rounds. In my first round, I was asked 3 questions. One was based on basic probability, one was based on DFS in a matrix (just the algorithm, not coding) and last one was an analytical puzzle. In the second round, it started with a discussion on my second year summer intern, then I was asked differences between arrays and linked lists, where can doubly linked lists be used in real life, etc. Then, there was a question on indexing in a DBMS, 2-3 direct questions from 50CP/brainstellar. The second round was much longer than the first one. \n\n2.) Quadeye:-\nHere, I had continuous 4-5 rounds without break, some were even 10 minute rounds. The questions were mostly based on probability and puzzles (not from brainstellar/50 CP, you need to think fast on the spot), 1-2 questions on describing the algorithm for a particular problem and even some on mental math (like 105 square, 39*41, etc).\n\n3.) Uber:-\nI gave one round only, since Quadeye made an on the spot offer. I had to code two questions, they were pretty straightforward. One was based on prefix sum and hashmaps and other was based on DFS on a binary tree.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n1.) For coding practice - Interview Bit and LeetCode\n\n2.) For probability and puzzles - 50 CP, Brainstellar and IB puzzles\n\n3.) For statistics - YouTube videos on hypothesis testing, regression \n\n4.) For OOPS theory - Tutorialspoint, Gfg\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nFor tests:- The hard part is getting shortlisted for interviews. Try to do regular coding practice over the summers if you're aiming for SDE profiles. I didn't do codeforces, codechef, etc, I focused on IB/LC only. For quant companies, few of them don't take tests and CPI plays an important role there. Like for GS, a high CPI will give you a better shortlisting chance even if you mess up your test. APT portfolio, alphagrep, GS, etc will have a section of questions on probability and statistics, JEE type math. Having practiced timed tests will definitely help you out here. For data science roles, brush up your ML knowledge. MS data science test had 2 questions in which we had to code models (regression using sklearn, etc) and also a section on theoretical MCQs. \n\nRevise all concepts of DSA, have a good theoretical grasp. Do not skip over graphs part while practicing coding. Be thorough with OOPS concepts too. Do not forget to do brainstellar and 50 CP if you're aiming for quant profiles (can be done in 2-3 days). In your summers, trying doing one project/intern in the area you're interested in along with intern prep. \nFor interviews, try doing 1-2 mock interviews before you give the real ones, it'll help you adjust to interview setting. \n\nLastly, keep in touch with seniors, ask them about the companies you're aiming for and their procedure. Take tips from them. It'll help you guide your preparation in the right direction.\n\n",

Think out loud. Interviewer wants to see your approach so you should keep explaining your thought process.\n2. Communicate well (very important to ace an interview).\n3. Try to catch the hints that the interviewers give. Usually when you are going in the wrong direction or taking a long time to reach to the solution, interviewers give you hints.\n4. If you think you are taking a lot of time, then ask the interviewer to guide you.\n5. Try to think of corner cases and build upon any cases that the interviewers tell.\n6.

My personal advice would be to First do each and every question from Interview Bit and keep learning things you don't know from geeks for geeks, for graphs and Binary search read theory (no need to do questions if you don't have much time) from the book I mentioned(CP-3 by Halim). For DP do every question from Interview Bit and also do some questions from CSES problem set for building confidence, for quant profile do Brainsteller and interview bit Puzzles, if you get stuck refer to GeeksforGeeks for that question and YouTube if still not clear.\n\n",

Test: Technical test was taken - OS / Network and CP based questions\n3. Interview Process: 2 Rounds of Technical and One small HR round. Both technical rounds revolved around probability , statistics , data structures and puzzles. The HR round was more of like a brainstorming session on dealing with a open ended finance problem. Just like an informal discussion.\n\nThe Resume selection criteria for all HFTs is just CPI along with your branch. Its simple as that. So if you are in CSE with 9.5+ , you should get in most HFTs interviews. Tower had a technical test, so you had to perform well in it be shortlisted. Interview rounds were hard, the data structure questions asked could be weighted at about 1900-2000 on codeforces. The probability ones were straight out of CS203 course and 50 interesting problems in statistics book. The informal HR round was fun.\n\nInterview Questions: You have 2 sticks with an error of ‘a%’ and ‘b%’ (while measuring length).

Here are some brief\ninsights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nGraviton (Quant), Microsoft (SDE), DE Shaw (SDE)\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nPeople from CSE and EE branches were allowed to give the coding test\n\nCoding test-\n1. There was 1 coding test of 3 hours duration. The test consisted of 1 question.\n2. The test was not too difficult. The time complexity bounds were also not too tight for the given constraints of the question which essentially meant that brute force solution also worked. Still, it was lengthy and one had to be careful with the edge cases. Apart from the number of test cases passed, the time taken to solve the problem was also a factor which was considered.\n\nInterview-\n1. It consisted of 2 rounds - HR and Technical\n2. A coding question was asked in the technical round. It was based DP. The problem asked in the interview was based on Knapsack\n3. The HR round had general questions like \"Why do you want to work for Samsung?\",\" Do you know anything about Korean culture?\", and things based on similar lines.\n\nCGPA plays a crucial role in getting shortlisted. 14 people were shortlisted for the interview, out of which 6 were finally selected. Among those 6 people, 5 were from CSE and 1 from EE. These numbers generally remain similar every year.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n1. For Coding- Interviewbit, leetcode, contests on Codeforces for time-bound practice. \n2. For Quant- Brainstellar, 50 challenging problems\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n1. I would say that first chalk out a plan for yourself because every person is in a\ndifferent scenario with varied strengths/ weaknesses, so try and figure out what\nworks best for you.\n2. Start early so that you have enough time to figure out things and prepare accordingly\n3. Talk to seniors.

In Tower, I was asked questions on standard deviation and variance on random variables, which was something I neither expected nor had prepared for. For optiver, you have to be really good at mental math and the concept of expectation in probability. \n\n##  Preparation Resources\n1.) For Quant -  Brainstellar and 50 Challenging Problems \n\n2.) For Software -  Interviewbit mostly. Preferred solutions given in discussion section of leetcode for the same questions. \n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n1.) If you're a student reading this before the summers, my first and most important advice would be for you to focus on increasing your cpi as much as you can. It is extremely important to get shortlisted in good companies. Definitely keep it above 9 if you're targeting Day 1 companies.\n \n2.) As for software profiles, Competitive programming is a must for companies Google and Rubrik, and maybe Uber too. For other companies like sprinklr, microsoft, etc just interviewbit would be fine.  \n\n3.) Now for Quant profiles, both brainstellar and 50 challenging problems, are necessary and sufficient. Do both of 'em twice at least. I was also asked mental math problems in some companies' interviews (Quadeye, Optiver). \n\n4.)Some general tips -  The projects and internships on your resume don't help much (at all?) in getting shortlisted for interviews. It's just CPI and tests. As for interviews, what's required is that you should be able to explain why you'd be a good fit for the company and the relevant role. For this, the relevant projects/internships can help.\n\n",

Here are some brief\ninsights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nHindustan Unilever (Techno Managerial)\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\n1. Resume Shortlist and personal questionnaire form : High CPI is important\n2. GD: Directed GD amd GD usually presents a moral dilemma as topic where you choose what to give priority to.\n3. Interview Process: There were 2 interviews in total post GD. The first interview was more on the technical side whereas the second was a general interview seeking to know more about your personality.\n\nThe personal questions form should be filled with care. The answers should show clarity in the direction you are headed. For the GD the best steps to follow are to be aware of others peoples points and not repeat. Also you should try to bring a different angle from others. Stick to your decisions and make arguments in a formal manner.\n\nThe GD question for me was related to a company which gave workers houses within the company plant. The house allocation was usually done on seniority basis however we were presented with a dilemma in this case were there were some special cases in addition to the senior most worker. We were to decide based on this who we would allocate the house to. The technical interview was focused primarily on my resume. They asked in depth about projects I was pursuing and some course related questions as well.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nMy preparation for the GD was done by interacting with some seniors and taking part in mock GD’s arranged by the ANC. After the GD I did some basic research into standard interview questions and prepared myself for those. Apart from this I also did some background research on the company I was interviewing for. We must be prepared for what we have written in our resume as they will surely pick up on those points and ask to explain them.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nBe thorough while preparing resume. Do not panic or feel dejected when you do not see your name in the list. Intern season is stressful, prepare well beforehand and dedicate time daily for your betterment. Apart from this focus on your soft skills as they also play an important role to get you intern.\n\n",

Quality of questions is really good. You should be comfortable with solving A/B/C/D problems in a CF Div 2 round.\n\n3.) Google - Resume shortlisting + test. Do participate in Kickstart/Codejam. If you secure good ranks in them, mention them on your resume as it is a big plus.\n\nInterviews:\n\n1.) HFTs software - Besides DSA, they might expect some knowlege of OOP preferably in C++.\n\n2.) Rubrik - Similar to test just in a different format.\n\n3.) Google - Tricky DSA problems. Also you need to code in a google doc.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nCodeforces, InterviewBit, Leetcode, Fifty challenging problems in Probability\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nTry to maintain a good CPI. Also start preparation early.\n\n",

Here are some brief\ninsights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nOptiver (Quant Trader), Jane Street(Quant), Optiver(Software), Sprinklr(Software) and APT Portfolio\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nKnowledge of various puzzles came in handy. Software interviews had questions on advanced DS (heaps and trees), computer fundamentals and cryptography applications (since it was mentioned in my resume). Some parts also connected to networking and systems design, although these topics weren't mandatory to cover.Quant interviews involved a lot of probability puzzles and games based on expected value (with added time constraints from the interviewers just to check how you react under pressure)\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nInterviewBit for DSA practice, 50 challenging problems for quant prep\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nThe first and foremost advice would be to be patient, and wait for the right opportunities rather than jumping blindly into everything. Build a strong academic background related to the profiles you're targeting. Try to be technically adept in DSA (and/or quant topics) by the time of tests.\nHowever, confidence is key for the interviews. Express your ideas freely and try to catch hints from the interviewer (trust me, they give a lot of subtle hints). Appropriate technical preparation always gives you a boost, but practice handling situations where you don't have any technical knowledge to answer the question. Reacting well to a pressure situation even when you're clueless about the question/subject is the most important interview skill in my opinion.\nBe patient, prepare well, and let your heart out! Best of luck!\n\n",

Type of question asked during interviews: There were a\ntotal of 4 interviewers, roughly interviewing for 15-20 min\neach:-\n\n        i. Basic introduction, general questions related to C/C++, STL implementations e.g. set vs unordered set, pass by value vs pass by reference etc.\n\n        ii. DSA questions on linked list.\n\n        iii. DSA questions covering DP, Stack, and Sorting.\n\n        iv. Puzzle round.\n\nd. No quant related question was asked as such since they\nalready asked the preference at the start of the interview.\n\ne. In general, the questions were basic to medium and one\ncould answer confidently given he/she has done a\ndecent prep.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nInterview Bit, LeetCode, GFG, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability, Gurmeet Puzzles and Brainstellar\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nDo:\n\n● Sitting for non-core/software roles, coding preparation, without any doubt, is a must.\nUtilize the summers well and be consistent in solving questions on coding platforms.\n\n● Put a bit of work daily on improving your communication skills. There is no fun if you\nknow the solution to an XYZ technical/HR question but fail to communicate it\neffortlessly to the interviewer.\n\n● Start working on building your resume and reviewing it from seniors early. Else it\nunnecessary creates last-minute panic.\n\nDon’t:\n\n● Waste time in comparing yourself to others and looking down upon yourself. Rather\nfocus on your own growth and efforts.\n\n● Pull other legs down or demotivate others. Intern/placement times could be\noverwhelming to one’s physical and mental health, and you should rather be\nsupporting and motivating others than making fun of their misery.\n\n",

The round is named AA round (As Appropriate). There is only one interviewer, and he has an experience of more than 20 years with Microsoft. Since I was a part of the mentorship program, the initial 15 mins discussion was on my project. He asked me to give a quick demo of my project, open the source code, and explain what I have done and why I did it. Then he asked about my previous internship experience, which was very brief (2-5 min only). After all this, they came to DSA ( Data Structure and Algorithm). He put one sample test case of the linked list in the comment box and asked me to predict the possible question. I predicted around 4-5 possible questions. Then he gave me a second test case, and I was successfully able to predict the questions. The question is straightforward once you predict the question. The question is as follows: Given a linked list, split it into two halves, reverse both halves, and connect the end of the first linked list. In the end, they ask me to code the same problem.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nTheory\n\n1. [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)\n\nVideo Lectures\n\n1.

Here are some brief insights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nNA\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nGoogle shortlists students directly on the basis of resume, without any tests. Having core EE projects on resume is the key.  There were 2 rounds of interview. First was based entirely on verilog . Second round was more focused upon the digital part of ESC201 and there was one coding question .If you are thorough with your concepts from EE courses, you can crack the interview . Some questions are tricky , but the interviewer keeps on giving hints at points where you get stuck. The questions are focused upon the real life application of your EE concepts.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n1) Most important is 2nd year core EE courses like EE210, EE200, EE250 and ESC201. Going through the lecture material , giving to you in these courses should be sufficient. \n\n2) You can also go through the CMOS inverters part of the EE370 lectures as a plus, if you are thorough with ESC201 and EE210. The EE370 lectures are available on YouTube.\n\n3) Having a decent knowledge of HDL, such as verilog/VHDL(any one) is also important for the interview process. I prepared for it from CS220 lectures (available on course website). However any online tutorial may suffice. The above resources are general for all core EE profiles.\n\n4) For software roles, I mainly focused upon solving questions from Interviewbit regularly and also revised ESO207 concepts.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n1) Luck factor plays a major role in the internship process. So do not worry if you are not able to get shortlisted or crack the interviews. Keep patience and believe in your skills , whatever profile you are preparing for. \n\n2) Also refrain from applying for every profile. Make sure, you decide by the start of the summers , which roles you are preparing for, and focus your time and energy on them. \n\nIn case of any other doubt , feel free to contact :)\n\n",

(HR)\n- All other questions were resume specific (most of it was  conversations)\n\n\nGeneral Insights\n- Having a good CGPA makes selection way easier.\n- Clear speech, logical structure in arguments and persuasiveness in manner beneficial in clearing the GD. Exposure to public speaking and GD practices will surely help. \n- Basic questions on core courses like EE330, ESO203, ESC201 can be asked. Although I was asked none. Same for Mechanical and Chemical core courses.\n- Have basic info for HR round like CEO name, products of the company, primary business market etc.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n- I did not specifically prepare for techno managerial profiles. I had been debating for a couple of years by then so it was relatively easier for me to crack the GD.\n- I watched a couple of youtube videos on basic tips to perform well GD before the GD.\n- Do not forget to ask your friends who have already been in one of the previous batches what the question was. I knew the question well in advance before the GD. Although the question was not super difficult, it could make a difference if you get more time to think about your answer.\n- I watched youtube videos on HR interview questions and correct answers to them. None of them helped as HR interviews are basically conversations. \n\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n- Have backup options ready if your target is techno-managerial profile because the number of good companies in this profile are very few. It is also possible because preparing for this profile does not require much hardwork.\n- If you have never done any kind of public speaking or any such activity, practicing GD with your friends can be really helpful.\n- Be as frank as you could during the interview. No need to fake. Most times the people interviewing you are extremely pleasant and make you feel comfortable. Take the interview just like a conversation. You wont even know when did the interview end.\n- Don’t worry if you don’t get it. A significant part of the process is luck.\n\n",

Here are some brief insights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nRubrik (Software), Sprinklr, Goldman Sachs, Quadeye(Systems), DE Shaw\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nGoogle: Google interview had some pretty original looking CP problems. So if someone is well versed with cp, it's a positive. I was asked a question on binary search in the first round (and certain interesting followups, which eventually led to a recursive solution). Just ensure that you know the behind-the-scenes implementation of whatever data structure you are using. In the second interview, I was asked a segment tree question. The second round was considerably harder than the first one.\n\nDE Shaw: DE shaw focuses a lot on the cs fundamental concepts. Be well versed with oops, os(if possible).\n\nRubrik: Rubrik tries to ask interesting questions in the interview. The questions were drawn from concepts in operating systems. It was an interesting interview for me personally.\n\nGoldman Sachs: GS asked basic DSA questions.Leetcode should be enough for this. \n\n##  Preparation Resources\nCodeforces, Leetcode, Atcoder, 50 Challenging Problems in Probabiltiy, Brainstellar\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nDo competitive programming. It might not seem relevant initially, but trust me once the tests start, it will work wonders. Also, CP enables your mind to always have a systematic approach, which is very much required in the interview. The interviewer is not there to just watch you code something up. While practicing, make it a habit to speak out your thought process. In the interview, make sure that you are able to convey everything you have in your mind to the interviewer. Finally, just be calm and remember that the interviewer is more of your colleague during the interview, and he/she will always be there to help you, in case you get stuck. All the best!\"\n\n",

I was also asked questions on the probability concepts relevant to machine learning and different classification and regression models and where and why those models were relevant. All the software roles that I interviewed for, required me to have a good command on competitive programming and DSA concepts. I had to code the  solutions to the problems in real time. Questions based on OOPS were also frequently asked. For most parts, the companies (Software roles) I interviewed for did not discuss my resume at length. \n\n##  Preparation Resources\nInterviewbit, Leetcode Medium level problems, CSES problem set, GFG for topic wise revision of DSA concepts and Machine learning Course by Andrew Ng.  \n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nThe process can be very stressful since luck plays a decent amount of role while getting you through interview shortlists and interviews. The key is to have faith in yourself and surround yourself with a good set of friends who are just as motivated and have your best interests in mind.

Here are some brief\ninsights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nOptiver, Samsung Korea, Google, Rubrik, Goldman Sachs, Quadeye, Graviton\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nSamsung Korea: Unbounded knapsack. SK's technical interview usually contains a well-known problem. Make sure you explain it slowly. SK's shortlisting criteria changes each year so don't read between the lines too much. SK's HR round is the most important. Try and watch a KDrama before. \n\nOptiver: You can't really prepare for Optiver's interviews. Best thing I can suggest is to understand market making well and to play estimation and market making games before with your friends.\n\nGoogle : Number of overlapping intervals, Dyanamic Programming\n\nRubrik: Subtree DP, Greedy that required a non-intuitive observation\n\nQuadeye: Estimation, PNC Expected value, and some useful limits and approximations in probability, Zero sum problem \n\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n50 Challenging problems, Brainstellar, Interview Bit, Cracking the coding interview, Codeforces\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n1) Best advice for coding would be to familiarise yourself with all the standard problems in different paradigms. Interview Bit does a good job at this. Then you can try LC medium or hard (depending on your comfort level). Also give archives seriously. It'll give you a rough idea of where you stand and also improve your temperament for giving timed tests. (refrain from using google during the contest). And it's also extremely important to be able to solve questions really quickly. On average you might get 20-30 mins per question, and you need to be able to write error free code within that time frame.\n\n2) For quant, just try and solve puzzles from the above mentioned sources and try and remember it (maybe note down interesting problems and the trick to solve it). There have been instances where I wasn't able to solve a question I had seen before in the pressure of an interview setting.\n\n3) Apart from all these technical things, the most important thing is to stay motivated and try and learn as much as you can during your preparation. I'm sure all of you are extremely smart and talented and can achieve anything you put your mind to. So believe in yourself! \n\n",

Basic - if you are new to coding then first pick up a coding language (preferably C++, read about STL), understand different Data Structures and learn basic algorithms for graphs since\nit is one of the favorite topics and build upon it.\n2. Advanced – There are different websites where you can practice questions from. I recommend solving Interview Bit since it has many relevant questions. Apart from this I personally used Leetcode during the initial part of preparation and CodeForces towards the end. CP algorithms is a nice resource to widen your coding toolbox.\n\nFor Quant –\n1. Revision Mso/hso\n2. 50 challenging Questions\n3. Brain stellar\n4. Xinfeng Chau\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nIf you fear giving interviews, then make sure you attend the mock interviews organized by both SPO and AnC Council. It is better to form a peer group while solving CP questions daily since there will be someone with whom you can discuss different approaches to solve the same problem. Always remember that interview is not just how much you know, but how much you can reproduce in a pressure situation. Maintain your nerves during the interview. While discussing the problem statement make sure you understand it perfectly, you need to ask the interviewer about the end cases. Think aloud during the interview so that interviewer can get to know the approach you are using. Start making resume at least a month before the submission and get it reviewed by some seniors.\n\n",

The whole process before the interview as well as the interviews are exhausting, physically as well as mentally. Have a support system with you (I had my family) and avoid distractions which might come in the form of any emotional or informational distress, during the process. Keep yourself healthy.\n\n2. Be yourself, with dress or coiffure, with knowledge, with language. Make your own plan, your goals and execute. Prepare for the placements keeping in mind that these are almost once in a lifetime opportunity. But also relax yourself as the placements are not the only opportunity in life.\n\n3. Enter the interview process with confidence and a little smile. Greet the interviewers, that usually breaks the ice.

For SDE: Start as early as possible. If you are novice, one year preparation will make you at par with what is required for the roles. Ample resources are there, so a plan is needed to optimize them.\n\n2. For Chemical Engineering Core: Refresh your fundamentals.

For Consultancy: Prepare all type of cases, read the books by IITB, IITM, IIM etc. Here also, ample resources are already available. You just need to make a plan and practice.\n\n# General:\n1. Collect resources -> Plan -> Prepare -> Practice -> Practice -> Perform\n2. Give as many mocks as possible before the interviews.\n3. Your resume is the pitch for you. Make it yours and make it strong. Attach stories to it for the interviews. Prepare it in and out.\n4. Prepare personalized HR questions beforehand. Impromptu attempt for HR question is only safe if you have prepared the standard HR questions well.\n5. एकै साधे सब सधै, सब साधै सब जाय : Don’t run for all the profiles, choose few and master them.\n\nConclusion: Madness is everywhere.

Resume Shortlist\n2. GD\n3. Written Test - The test comprises of - Aptitude - Logical Reasoning - Quant - Computer Science Fundamentals (OS, CSO, etc). All questions were MCQ.\n\nThere are two compulsory rounds of 45 minutes. One round was more on theoretical concepts of computer architecture and the other was on practical implementations (coding) of some hardware modules and some questions to judge the analysis skills.\n \nInterview 1 (Theoretical): Only discussed the projects related to computer architecture and created new scenarios in the hardware (like if cache hierarchy is exclusive instead of inclusive what would happen, etc.). To answer the questions, one requires good knowledge of the subject Computer Organization and Architecture (CS622 ACA covers everything). \n\nSome questions were -\n \n• What is prefetcher, how would one identify the optimum lookahead value of prefetcher. \n\n• Questions on various cache hierarchies. Disadvantages and advantages of inclusive \ncache hierarchy. Design a new cache replacement policy that removes the problem of inclusive victims of inclusion cache hierarchy (There is no solution to the problem without compromising the bandwidth, the interviewer just wants to check your analysis skills. So come up with various approaches and have a discussion on pros and cons.). Cache replacement policies - LRU, Belady. \n\n• Cache coherence protocols, sparse directory, bus snooping. (Questions related to the project in the resume) \n\nInterview 2 (Practical): Discussed project. Then asked to share screen and code to implement a cache with LRU cache replacement policy. After the successful implementation using hashmap, the interview asked on the aspects of performance on using link-list, vectors to implement the cache and LRU instead of hashmap. Performance in terms of time and space complexity, temporal and spatial locality of the application in your own laptop's cache, i.e. which will give better performance when the application is executed on your laptop. Answer - Vector will give better performance as it will enjoy spatial locality as all elements of the array are stored contiguous in the memory whereas link list is not necessarily stored contiguous (once some of the nodes are deleted). Link list also consumes more space, so it will also require more memory accesses as compared to vector.\n \nSample Interview Questions:\n \nQuestions on working of DRAMS - channels, row hit, row miss, banks, case where two subsequent dram requests will take the most time to service. \nI was asked to code for the implementation of the LRU (Least Recently Used) Policy of the cache replacement policy. \n\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nIf you are shortlisted for the interview for this profile and you are not interested, say that in the interview that you want to go for pure SE role and don't want to go in computer architecture. Many students did that and interviewers didn't mind at all and wished them luck for other companies. \n\n",

They look for peaks like\nhigh CPI, Day-1 Internship, Research publications, etc.\n2. Buddy Case practice: After the shortlist, a buddy is assigned to help in your case\npreparation. Timing is such that you can practice maximum 3-4 cases with your buddy\nso one should not rely only on these.\n3. Final Interviews (Day1, Slot1):\nRound 1 - (Manager Round)\nA guesstimate or case interview. Experience varies individually.\nRound 2 - (Partner Round)\nCan be a case interview or a general HR discussion. Experience varies individually.\n\nPro tip- Know your resume inside out. You can be grilled on every single word you\nmention on the resume.\n\nInsights on Interview Process:\n\nSome special Notes about the Arthur D. Little interview process-\n1) The major bottle neck is the Resume shortlisting. Only 15-20 people get shortlisted\nfrom all the people that apply.\n2) The Buddy sessions are non-evaluative, so make proper use of them to get a good\nflavor of what can be expected in the interviews. Try to talk to the buddies about the\ncompany and what they expect from you. This is the part of the process where you\ncan understand if the company is really a right fit for you.\n3) The final interviews can be radically different from person to person. Some might find\nthem extremely easy and some might struggle. It depends highly on the interviewer.\nDo not assume anything about what they might ask or how you might perform. Just\nfocus on giving your best.\n\nSample Interview Questions:\n\nRound-1(Manager round)-\n1) Basic HR questions and questions on resume(I can't remember exactly what\nquestions)\n\n2) Guesstimate-\nEstimate the quantity of denim cloth used in Mumbai in one year. (Interviewer was only\n\ninterested in the approach. Once I cleared up my approach, the interviewer did not\nallow me to put numbers and perform calculations. He simply acknowledged the\napproach and closed the interview)\n\nRound-2 (Partner round)-\nThere were no questions in the interview. It was just a conversation with both of us\nsharing our opinion on topics of interest and discussing how they might be relevant to\nanyone in their regular lives. In my opinion, the partner wanted to check how well I\nwould fit in the company and how well can I communicate with clients on project.\n\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nDrive link to the consulting preparation material:\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2qQx5DAQoeINUF4cmgwbEk5RXM?resourcekey=0-IcVEnTmMJnLGd7VcWxFydw](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2qQx5DAQoeINUF4cmgwbEk5RXM?resourcekey=0-IcVEnTmMJnLGd7VcWxFydw)\n\nA very helpful Youtube channel for case interview prep-\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/CraftingCases](https://www.youtube.com/c/CraftingCases)\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n1) Start making your master resume from the summers before 7th semester itself. You\ncan add anything new you do later on. Get the resume looked at by as many seniors\nand friends as possible. Do not write anything on the resume that cannot be\nconfidently defended.\n2) Form groups for practicing cases and begin practicing as soon as you can after the 6th\nsemester. Practicing cases individually is not useful. To get an idea about case\nsolving, you can practice a few cases with seniors. Utilize the buddy round cases for\nunderstanding the general flavor of cases expected in the interviews.\n3) Be confident during the interviews. Since this is a client facing role, you need to have\ngood communication skills. Keep smiling and do not get frustrated by your\ninterviewer’s conduct, they might be stress-testing you.\n4) Read as much as you can about the company. It helps in asking good questions\nduring the interviews and assures the company of your interest in the firm.\n\n",

        "content": "\nPerikala Sandeep, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech. student in EE will be joining Intel Technologies Pvt. Ltd. as Hardware Engineer. Here are some brief\ninsights of hers.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nElectronics :\n1. Google Hardware – Silicon Engineer\n2. Intel\n3. TI – Digital Engineer\n4. TI – Analog Engineer\n5. Ceremorphic Technologies – SoC Engineer\n\nElectrical :\n\n1. JLE\n7. Ola Mobility\n8. AirBus\n9. TATA steel\n\nOthers:\n\n10. Rakuten\n11. Accenture Solutions\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\n1. Resume Shortlist - It has a CPI criterion of 7(for UG) and open for EE – BT, MT, Dual, Double Major.\n2. Test - The test has 2 sections\n- Aptitude (15 ques – 20 min)\n- Technical (45 ques – 70 min)\n\nThe interview process for INTEL is very random compared to the other VLSI companies I have attended. They didn’t frame any continuous questions. They have started the interview by asking about my projects and asked related digital topics which were used in the project. Then, the 2 members of the panel asked questions on different VLSI concepts like Verilog, Digital Design etc.\n\nI have also given interviews for Google Hardware, TI – analog and digital. In Google Hardware, they expect coding skills along with core knowledge. In TI – Digital, I was asked to draw different voltage and current graphs by hand for different circuits. In TI – Analog, They asked me questions from the test paper by changing the circuits like diodes and some RC RL related questions.\n\nSample Interview Questions:\n\n1. Draw a transistor level Inverter and add a capacitor, What will the voltage and currentwaveforms?\n2. Verilog Code of D Flip Flop, Gray Counter etc and explaining each line of the code\n3. Some Array based questions in Google Hardware\n4. Different VLSI concepts like STA analysis, Digital Design etc\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nI have received most of the material from my senior who is placed in VLSI role. He told me the kind of questions that will be asked in test and interviews and shared the NPTEL playlists for Verilog and Digital Design. ESC201, EE210, EE370, EE619 course material. EE619 is very useful for interview process. Apart from these, I used to see blogs and some famous youtube channels like all about electronics, neso academy etc.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nThe general advice would be to take the tests seriously, prepare well by going over past years’ repositories, and working on areas where one might me relatively weak. Start preparation early and shape the resume fit for the role. For interviews, try to polish communication skills and temperament. You don’t need to answer every question correctly. Try to do as best as you can.\n\n",

Online Assessment – 6 Quant question and 5 coding question in 2hrs.\n3. Only one interview of 2 hours.\n\nInsights on Interview Process :\n\nNote that Interviews are more of a discussion rather than a question-answering\nsession. So, try to involve the interviewer while solving a question.\nDo not stress on HR prep much if you are focusing on quant or software. I was not asked a\nsingle HR question in any of my interviews.\nThe interviews will indeed be stressful try to take small breaks if you want and most\ninterviewers are chill about it.\nPrioritize your companies accordingly – Don’t just sort the companies in decreasing order of\nthe pay. Try to have an idea how difficult these interviews will be and if possible have one or\ntwo backup company interviews in between the dream companies.\n\nInterview Questions :\nThese are some of the questions that were asked :\n\nQuant \n1. How would you estimate the value of pi using n sided die\n2. Use a 1-5 random number generator to create 1-7 random number generator and code it\n3. There are 2 random variables in unit of cm let’s say x and y having autocorrelation as some\nrho. Now X and Y are the same random variables but in units of m or km what is the new\nautocorrelation?\n\nSoftware \n1. Snake Ladder Question(interviewbit)\n2. A simple binary tree question\n3. Binary Search in matrix(can’t remember the exact question)\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nI prepared mostly for quant and software.\n\nFor Quant you can use standard resources that are there - 50 CP, Brainstellar and Xinfeng\nzhou. Understand the concept behind each of the problems.\n\nFor coding – Leetcode and Interviewbit\nSometimes for quick revision or for learning a new algorithm I often referred to this website -\n[https://cp-algorithms.com/](https://cp-algorithms.com/)\nI’m sharing some of the docs I made of the question that I thought were important\n\n1.

Know each and every word for your resume. Go through the codes of the projects that\nyou did to have a more clear understanding. Don’t just skip it ki upar upar se dekh lete\nhain.\n2. Start early – I started around May (Side by side with my research work). Try to do\nsome coding side by side with your internship work this will help in your ppo interviews\nas well.\n3. Try before giving up on any skill – I know many people just giving up on coding\nbecause they had a bad esc101 grade. I would suggest try it, give it a month or so and\neven then, if it’s not working for you and then you can move onto any other skillset.\n4. CPI – try maintain a decent CPI. CPI helps you in getting shortlisted for the companies\na lot more than you think.\n\nDon’ts :\n1. Do not stress if you did not get a 3rd year internship. Try to get one from LinkedIn or\nelse try to self-projects and build your resume.\n\n",

Shortlisting was primarily done on the basis of CPI and department (CSE, EE, MTH) which I find a very unfair way of doing things based on my experience of the skills of people. There were 3 rounds of interviews, all technical.\n\nFirst round was technical, the question was not that tough and there was more emphasis on implementation. In the next round, they asked questions about my resume and about my future plans and told me details about the company as they are a fairly new startup. The last round had a medium level coding question on parenthesis.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\n* Leetcode\n* Geeks for geek articles\n* [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)\n* Codeforces\n* [Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/)\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n* Start early and try to solve some questions every day\n* Keep a list of questions or concepts you struggled with and revise it after 2-3 weeks\n* Don’t waste your time on high-level topics a lot and focus more on the basics\n* Thinking about the solution is important so don’t jump straight to the answers if you can’t solve something\n* Eat healthily and take 6-8 hrs of sleep during the placement season. You won’t want to get sick at that time.\n* Do some physical exercise, jogging, etc. This will help with stress.\n* Feel free to contact any senior and ask for advice. They will be happy to help!\n\n",

Written test – aptitude, programming and technical \n3. Three rounds of interview \n\nI only gave 3 rounds of interviews for Qualcomm. It was my first ever experience of placement interviews as I never sat for placements in B.Tech. I was nervous but the interviewers were quite helpful and friendly. They were giving hints and guiding me if I was stuck in some question. So, such friendly interaction lessened my nervousness. I tried to give intuitions for the questions | didn't know the exact answers. \n\n##  Preparation Resources\n1. Communication Systems book by Simon Haykin \n2. Digital Signal Processing book by Oppenheim - Chapter 4 and 5 only \n3. Geeks for Geeks for C language based questions \n4. Gate level aptitude questions \n5. Previous written test and interview questions given by seniors \n\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nPrepare your basics very well. Instead of tough questions first solve easier ones in written test since there will be time constraints. Don't spend much time on a single question. There may be negative markings so avoid guess work. Prepare all three sections well, don't take the aptitude section lightly. It can be the most scoring section. Keep practicing at least 10 questions daily for aptitude and C output questions. Force yourself to do so even if you feel like skipping. Consistency is better than perfection. For the interviews don't sit silently even if you don't know the exact solution. Try your best guess. If it's correct the interviewers will guide you further. If it's not, they may give you some hints to start off and build upon further. \n\n",

Based on a partial reversal of the Linked List.\nQ2. BFS Traversal on a Matrix of 0s and 1s.\nResume Project based questions.\nQuestions on differences between C++ and Python. Why C++ used in Game Development ?\nBe very neat in writing code. Keep it modular, use functions, give proper names to the\nvariables. Also don’t forget to ask questions and clarify the problem and input before solving it.\nRound 2 (Technical + Behavioral + HR based):\n\nThis interview round was with a senior manager at Microsoft.\nThe interviewer asked me to ask questions about Microsoft or anything I wanted to know\nabout Microsoft or its products. It was pretty behavioral and challenging.\nI asked her about the team structure and workflow, new products they were working on and\nabout the Underwater Data Centers they are building (The interviewer was very impressed by\nthis question. I had earlier watched a video regarding the same !).\nThen she asked me a question on Semaphores Design, which after some help I was able to\nexplain satisfactorily. I had told her during the conversation that I am not from a CS\nBackground, so she gave me hints whenever I got stuck.\nRest of the interview was about deep-diving on technologies and further questions that\nemerged due to our conversation. There was a good amount of verbal technical\ncommunication that happened. Be good at it !\nBoth the rounds were about 1 hour each.\n\nResult: Offer !\n\nJPMC Interview:\nRound 1 (Programming + Technical):\nAround 45 minutes interview.\nInterviewer asked me to reverse the Linked List and write a code for it.\nDetailed questions and explanations of OOPS Concepts with examples.\nDifferences between C++ and Python.\nProbability questions on Expectation and Integral Evaluations.\nAsked me to write the code for Dijkstra. Follow up questions on priority queue and heaps were\nalso asked.\n\nRound 2 (Mathematics):\nHard Probability problems on Expectation and Variance.\nIntegral Evaluation - Medium\nJoint Probability Distribution\nQuestion on Leibnitz Theorem.\nSome basic math puzzles.\nI solved about 3.5 questions out of 5. But the interviewer was very helpful.\nDiscussion on life as a quantitative analyst.\nFor preparation, one can look up at brainstellar.com problems and solve questions from 50\nChallenging Problems in Probability.\nRound 3 (HR):\nBasic HR stuff, discussion of the offer, opportunities, activities etc.\n\nResult: Offer !\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nMy preparation was mainly through LeetCode, InterviewBit and Brainstellar. I had made up\nmy mind to target SDE/ML and Quant/Analytics roles.\n\nInterviewBit is a great resource. I went through the tutorials on DS/Algo, articles on ML and\nother CS Fundamental topics: OOP, CN, DBMS and OS. Try to practice 2-3 questions from\neach basket.\n\nI also learnt SQL and practiced writing queries here. Also one can go through some of the\nsystem design questions as well to get to know more about real world software engineering. It\nmay help you in some of the advanced technical rounds of some startups.\n\nBesides these, I regularly attempted Weekly and Bi-Weekly contests on LeetCode, apart from\nsolving mock assessments on LC and practicing mock interviews on IB. Be consistent in your\npractice, it will help you a lot !\n\nFor puzzles, I practiced questions from the 50 Challenging Problems in Probability,\nBrainstellar and InterviewBit puzzles sections. For aptitude, I practiced solving past CAT\npapers and enrolled in a placement preparation test series by PrepLeaf.\n\nBut 80% of my time was spent practicing more and more DSA questions and studying ML, CS\nFundamental articles on GFG, IB, Medium etc.\n\nRegarding resume, I would suggest everyone to go through the SPO Preparation Folder. Just\nkeep it precise and crisp, not exceeding 1 page. Make sure you are prepared to defend each\nand every point written on it, even from the extracurricular section. Also, do get it reviewed\nmultiple times by at least 5 seniors, till you get satisfied.\n\n* [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/practice/)\n* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)\n* [Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/)\n* [SPO Preparation Portal](http://spo.iitk.ac.in/preparation/)\n* [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/)\n* [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-asked-interview-questions-os-dbms-cn-harsh-agarwal/)\n* [SOCE](https://soce-iitk.herokuapp.com/Samyak_Jain)\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nSome very important tips:\n\nTake care of yourself and your health. Keep it a top priority. Indulge in some form of physical\nactivity or workout which you can do regularly without losing out a lot of energy and disturbing\nyour schedule and commitments. It will help you to stay motivated, healthy and happy.\n\nTake care of your mental health. Switch off the notification of Social Media apps, if it takes\naway your peace of mind. Find a close friend, with whom you can ease out your post\nassessment stress and share your experiences. It will help you out a lot !\n\nTake ample rest, but do follow a schedule. Be in touch with your seniors, you can’t imagine\nhow motivating and helpful their advice can be ! Trust them, they have also gone through\nsimilar experiences.\n\nRegarding resume, I would suggest everyone to go through the SPO Preparation Folder.

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\nOptiver- SDE and Quant, Jane Street, Glean US and India, Alphagrep- Software, Graviton- Quant, Quadeye- Quant and System, DE Shaw, Goldman Sachs\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\nTower Research Capital: A mix of CS fundamentals, algorithmic questions and puzzles were asked in the interview which lasted for about 1.5 hours.\r\n\r\nOptiver: You cannot really prepare fully for the interviews, but the interviews for quant role are based on market making (you'll be introduced to the topic at a suitable time by the company itself) and probability (expectation to be precise). You should become fluent in the terminology used in market making for quant interviews/ group discussions and also be prepared to make approximations under time pressure. For the SDE interviews, system design is helpful.\r\n\r\nJane Street: The initial rounds are based on expectation, you don't have to find the exact value. Most of the time, a qualitative analysis will do. The final round is a bunch of interactive games on market making and probability. In the final interview, there are 3 rounds which take around 4 hours in total.\r\n\r\nAlphagrep: The topics of questions asked ranged from C++ syntax (because I was more comfortable in C++ than Java) to OOPs to algorithmic questions (some of them required theoretical arguments, others were about implementation) similar to those asked on codeforces/interviewbit. A lot of questions were asked in an interview that lasted for 1.5-2 hours.\r\n\r\nQuadeye: In the systems role, some puzzles were asked in the first round. The second round was mostly OOPs and syntax of C++.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nI focused on CP (InterviewBit), puzzles (Brainstellar and GfG), and probability (50 challenging problems, CS203, some common problems like coupon collector, ballot problem, etc.) because I wanted to prepare for Quant and SDE roles. I used to switch between InterviewBit and Brainstellar to prevent the process from being monotonic.\r\nThe test series by SPO and PClub were helpful in CP, and the DSA timeline provided by SPO especially helped prepare in a structured way.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\n1. Have a plan for your preparation. Don't waste your time preparing for roles that you're not interested in.\r\n2. Doing interviewbit is strongly recommended because it helps both in the coding tests as well as the interviews. Often, questions are asked directly from interviewbit.\r\n3. Finish your preparation/revision strictly before the tests begin, you will not be getting time to prepare afterwards because of the hectic schedules of the tests.\r\n4. Keep your health the first priority.\r\n5. For software roles (and even some quant roles) being familiar with OOPs along with keywords/syntax is very beneficial (at least in one language, C++ recommended) because questions are often asked about them.\r\n6. If there is a clash between two interviews, make sure to give the one whose role you prefer more. Do NOT postpone a more preferred role/company for later.\r\n\r\n",

Even if you are not good at CP, they look more towards your\r\napproach to a problem, your creativity in the solution. As the projects on\r\nyour resume and courses such as DSA are the only signs of your\r\ncoding experience, they question you heavily on the resume. They also\r\ntest your sincerity towards your work based on your answers to these\r\nquestions.\r\nThey want efficient solutions and that’s why much focus is on the\r\noptimization problems w.r.t both memory and time.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\n1.

After completing Interviewbit, LeetCode Hard questions for Graph and DP practice\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nDo’s\r\n1.) Even if you haven’t studied DSA, it is quite possible that through regular practice in\r\nthese 2.5 months, you can crack the coding questions of most companies. So, do\r\nutilise it tu the fullest.\r\n2.) At first build your base in C++ STL. Get comfortable with vectors, pairs at first , solve\r\nthe questions on Interviewbit and LeetCode. Then move further as per the SPO\r\nschedule.\r\n3.) Maintain a notebook to note the questions which you found tricky and difficult. Note the\r\nquestion and its approach after coding the solution. It is going to be highly useful in\r\nJuly end when you will need to revise all the 400-500 questions you have solved.\r\n4.) Make interview 2-way communication. Don’t hesitate to tell your approach(even if\r\nwrong) to the interviewers. They will try to correct you with hints.\r\n5.) Any firm will look for your interest in the firm. Most of the interviewers are firm\r\nemployees, so try to build a bond with them by taking their introduction, what work\r\nthey do in the firm and what they expect from you as a candidate. Don’t forget to ask\r\nabout the interview feedback at the end. These things will leave a positive impact on\r\nthem after the interview.\r\n6.) In last few days, solve random questions using a timer and note the time taken.\r\n\r\nDon’ts\r\n\r\n1.) Don’t take a long leave from coding in the summer if you are a beginner.\r\n2.) Never boast in front of an interviewer about your skills and abilities. Don’t\r\nexaggerate them. It makes a negative impact about your attitude and honesty.\r\n\r\n",

I was asked for my introduction, then 2 coding problems and 2 short answer questions. First Coding Problem - 'You are given two sticks of some given length. You can break each of these sticks into as many pieces as you want. Finally you have to choose 4 sticks of equal length out of all those sticks and form a square. You have to report the side length of the maximum area square which you can from.' Second Coding Problem - 'Find the maximum path sum between any two leaf nodes in a binary tree'. Then I was asked about the definitions of postorder and inorder traversal of a binary tree.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nI did coding on Competitive coding websites like 'Codeforces' and 'Codechef', but mainly on Codeforces. I also practiced from Interviewbit. 'Puzzles' as well as 'Programming' section of Interviewbit helped a lot.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nMy advice to students sitting for internship next year would be to thoroughly complete each and every problem from Interviewbit (Programming and Puzzles sections). And also learn about Object Oriented Programming. It would be good if you have knowledge of the following 3 languages - C++, Java and Python. For Quant profiles, you should do Interviewbit puzzles and Brainstellar compulsorily. Additionally, you could also solve the book named '50 Challenging Problems'.\r\n\r\n",

I was also asked a couple of programming questions in the first round, I didn't have to code them but had to explain the approach to be taken. The second round invloved puzzles and questions on statistics and probability. The two rounds were then followed by a short HR round.

Interviews are usually short and ask somewhere between 3 to 5 questions.\r\n\r\nFor ML, revise the common ML algorithms, and how when you can use them. Be well versed with the projects on your resume. Also go through various data manipulation techniques that are used in ML applications.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nFor Quant, use Brainstellar and 50 Problems in Probability.\r\nFor Consult follow Case Interview Cracked, Case in Point and IIMA Handbook.

I only had one interview round.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nMostly solved coding problems from interviewbit & cses problem set.\r\nThroughout the summer I solved around 400+ DSA problems and have been doing competitive programming from 3rd semester. \r\nMy CPI was low so I was having a hard time getting shortlisted for many companies. \r\nI didn't prepared anything specific to core as my main aim was for SDE roles.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nFocus on your CPI. No matter which role you want to get it be it software, quant, consulting etc. a good CPI will always give you edge over others in getting shortlisted for technical test/interviews. Once you reach the interview stage it won't be that much of a trobule. \r\nAs for someone who is aming for SDE roles I would suggest to start early and be consistent at it. Start with interviewbit, solve cses problems and give contest regularly. It would be more than sufficient.\r\n\r\n",

This gives an opportunity for all students to get shortlisted,\r\nas most students can easily score quite well in the tests. Amex comes\r\nafter a main cohort of companies come together in the so-called “Day\r\n1”, so most of the students will have a good idea of how to appear for\r\nthe tests properly.\r\nFor the interview selection, there were most likely more factors than just\r\nthe test scores. So resume will definitely play a role here. Try to do one\r\nproject/internship for keeping your chances towards the safe side. It is\r\nnot necessary to be an expert in ML/AI, as I myself didn’t have any\r\n\r\nprojects in that domain.\r\nDuring the interview, make sure you are calm and confident. The\r\ninterviewers are very friendly and try to make you comfortable. Make\r\nsure you answer all the questions without self-doubt. Also make sure\r\nyou have thoroughly gone through each and every point of your\r\nresume. They will enquire deeply to a particular point if its relevant to\r\nthe role.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\n 50 challenging problems in probability\r\n Andrew Ng course on Basics of Machine learning\r\n Try a few case study problems (completely optional)\r\nNothing much else in terms of resources.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nThe interview is mostly HR related, so having a good speaking skill will be very helpful for the\r\nprocess. Speaking with confidence, and owning your words is also important to them, so be\r\nmindful of what you reply.\r\nGoing through your resume is very important. Make sure you know all the points in there, and\r\ntry not to fumble on any of the points.\r\n\r\nThe internship season is undeniably a very stressful period. But make sure you don’t stress\r\nout before of during the interview. Clear your mind for at least 2 hours prior. Speak with\r\ndelight and stay calm. Enjoy the process, as many opportunities will come in your way.\r\n\r\n",

And give the pclub contest seriously because they are the real test to measure your preparation.\r\nEnough of coding now the next part needed especially for Quant profile is probability for which first finish \"50 challenging problems\", then brainstellar, if you still have time left then go for \"practical guide for quantitative finance\". \r\nNow your are ready for the interview all the best\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nPlan your preparation and complete interviewbit, branstellar and 50 challenging problem.

Prof. Baquer Mazhari’s lectures for ESC201, available on YouTube\r\n2. HDLbits for Verilog practice\r\n3. PYQs of relevant core courses done in IITK\r\n4. Other youtube lectures and channels like Neso Academy\r\n5. Coding from Interviewbit (mainly for other profiles)\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nDos:\r\n1. Think out loud in interviews. Keep talking through whatever you’re doing to get to the\r\nsolution. For the interviewer, how you reached the answer is just as important as the\r\nanswer you got.\r\n2. The interviewer is not your opponent. Learn to find cues in what they say, they often\r\nnudge us in the right direction.\r\nDon’ts:\r\n1. Don’t try to answer questions from courses that you haven’t studied. Just tell them and\r\nthey will avoid questions from that area.\r\n\r\n",

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\nQuadeye(Systems), Tower Research Capital(Quant), Samsung Korea (Core/Research), Microsoft (Software)\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\nI had four interviews in total on Day-1. Two (Tower and Quadeye) were offline and the rest (Samsung and Microsoft) were online.\r\n\r\nTower Research : I was asked questions from probability and some puzzles. The problems were really tricky and they really took a lot of time and thinking. I think doing the last 15-20 questions from 50 CP and hard problems from Brainstellar properly might give you some exposure to the level of questions asked here. Though, I still feel the level of questions was slightly more difficult. For example, one of the questions was based on a slight modification of Minimum Spanning Tree.\r\n\r\nQuadeye : There were four rounds. In the first three rounds, they asked some probability questions and puzzles. The topics covered expected values, mean, variance of probability distributions, puzzles, etc. The difficulty was that of Brainstellar Easy+Medium, and 50 CP. The questions were quite interesting, but not that difficult. Some of the questions were: 1. find the 80th percentile element in an unsorted array in linear time, 2. A 6-sided fair dice is rolled n times, define a random variable Xi to denote the number of times the ith face showed up, then find the covariance of X1 and X2, 3. Estimate the sum of the square root of first 49 natural numbers, etc. \r\n\r\nSamsung Korea : This was a very smooth experience (except for the miserable internet connection). I was first sent to the HR round. They asked me about my future goals and why did I apply for Samsung, and similar questions. It went on for about 20-25 minutes. Next, there was a small technical round where I was asked questions about my resume(my projects and internship experience), and a question from String manipulation (easy one). \r\n\r\nMicrosoft : There were two rounds. Both were related to DSA. Some questions were easy and some were tricky. The questions were : 1. Second smallest element in array, 2. find the peak element in an array (and some variations), and 3. A string pattern matching question based on KMP algorithm (slight variation).\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nFor the SDE role, I focused mainly on competitive programming and DSA. I didn't have much CP experience at the start of my preparation. I started focusing on CP properly after the beginning of my 4th sem. I tried to solve 1-2 problems daily from the codeforces problem set. I started covering topic-wise DSA from interviewbit. It took me around one month to complete all the topics properly. I also took notes of the topics and questions where I was stuck which were quite helpful at the time of revision. I was also regular in giving the contests on Codeforces and Codechef. Besides this, I also participated in some of the contests organized by Pclub. Contests really helped me improve my CP skills and solve problems in limited time. But, first learn properly about C++ STL from any online source (GFG preferably) before solving harder problems. So to summarize, Codeforces + Interviewbit + Proper revision of DSA should be enough to do better in Coding rounds and Interviews as far as SDE roles are concerned. I was done with all this one week before the tests started. Hence, I solved some problems from Leetcode Hard as well but that's completely optional if you have done rest of the things mentioned above properly.\r\n\r\nFor the Quant roles, I covered 50 Challenging Problems, Brainstellar, Cut-the-knot problemset, and Xinfeng Zhou's Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews. Before solving questions, ensure that you have revised the basic probability concepts such as Expected values, means, variance, probability distributions, Geometric Probability, etc. These topics are covered in the Probability courses such as CS203 or MSOs. The order of solving problems was as follows : 50 CP -> Brainstellar -> Xinfeng Zhou -> Cut-the-knot. You need not solve all of them. Just solve 50 CP and brainstellar properly (atleast twice). Then, move to the last two if you have time. You need not have a good knowledge of finance or markets beforehand.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nMaintain your CPI (the most important advice) and improve your problem-solving skills. Most of the coding tests require decent CP skills for you to get shortlisted. Hence, along with Interviewbit/Leetcode, also invest some time on solving problems from Codeforces/giving contests. The earlier you start, the better you get at this. Be consistent. Another important thing that most people overlook is that you have to maintain your temperament throughout. At times, you might feel quite nervous and frustrated. You will want the process to end as soon as possible. Avoid this sort of thinking. In your free time, do breathing exercises, meditate for a while, exercise. In the summers, try to get a project/internship which doesn't affect your preparation too much. During the summers, try to fix your routine and devote a fixed amount of time to preparation consistently. Maintain your health and stay calm even if you get an unexpected result. Stay calm, maybe there is something better waiting for you at the end :)\r\n\r\n",

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\nNK Securities\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\nAPT Portfolio:\r\nThere was a technical test round. It consisted OOPs(kind of subjective where you had to explain the output) and 2 coding questions(little different from other coding rounds). Followed by it, there were 2 rounds of technical interview. In round 1, I was first asked about a particular project in my resume, followed by some conceptual questions in C++ like difference between unordered and ordered maps, diff between new and malloc, etc. Then there were 2 coding question, where I had to write complete code on the ide. Coding questions were easy and I was able to do that comfortably. In the next round, I was asked coding questions  \r\n\r\nSpecial Tip: PLEASE DO OOPs questions, you can find all concepts on various websites. I would suggest do interviewbit oops questions and concepts. This is in general, many companies had some questions of OOPs, mostly in the form of MCQs or predicting outputs.\r\n\r\nFor quant tests, it was mostly brainstellar and 50 challenging probs book. During the interview, the questions were good and you had to think solution or strategy instantly, I had not seen those questions before.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nI started preparing during the summers. For software roles, I solved Interviewbit covering essential data structures and algorithms. I think graphs and trees is most important topic(many of them say its DP but in my case maximum companies had graphs more than DP !). Try to solve question in programming section of Interviewbit. If you are unable to solve a question, do see the solution rather just skipping it. You never know if that question comes in a test or interview !! (happened in my case).\r\nFor quant roles I solved brainstellar and 50 Challenging Problems book. I think that covered most of the questions asked in technical tests as well as interviews.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nDon't take unnecessary stress and always be optimistic .\r\nTalk to your friends, discuss with them and help them in case if they are facing any problems.\r\nAll the best !\r\n\r\n",

It's always tempting to switch to other resources. But it usually causes mental chaos. Maintaining consistency is key, and while it's important to take breaks, they should be of reasonable length. Short breaks can indeed be beneficial at times, but it's essential to avoid excessively long breaks that might hinder your progress.\r\n\r\nThe crucial advice for your coding round interview is to refrain from silently solving questions during the session. Always try to speak whatever is coming into your mind. Even if you end up not solving the question, then also you will be able to show your approach to the interviewer.\r\nConsider HR interviews a fun question-answer session rather than some serious business. HR interviewers generally look for how frankly you can communicate with your peers. Always try to give some example from your experience, which can be remotely related to the question, but it still makes a better impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

While having a\r\nlook try to relate your mechanical concepts to their\r\nworking.\r\n Try to have a decent CPI. But if it is not so good, don’t\r\nworry. They will focus on your core projects too. Try to\r\nhave a good project under a professor or in any Team or\r\nclub.\r\n Learn some basic C++. The coding questions are easy and\r\nscoring.\r\n Have a habit of Practicing some aptitude questions from\r\nthe SPO preparation portal or from any other source.\r\n Revise all your core courses thoroughly (mainly\r\nthermodynamics, manufacturing, etc)\r\n Know about the company well, before the interview. And be\r\nprepared with the reasoning for why you want to join JLR.\r\nThis is a typical question for every company.\r\n Try to look smart, don’t panic if you can’t answer a question\r\nin the interview. Just say that you don’t know (in a formal\r\nway). Or try to explain how much you know (they will judge\r\nyour thought process, not the final answer).\r\n\r\n They will ask for an intro. Avoid having it too short or too\r\nlong. Just say confidently what you are (try to cover all the\r\nthings that you want them to know). Prepare this intro\r\nbefore itself, it will help in other company interviews also,\r\nto get a good start by avoiding awkward stammering.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nNothing special. Just the coursework and projects help. Find suitable resources for basic\r\ncoding in C++ and for aptitude (there are plenty of them).\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\n It’s ok if you stammer or panic in the interview. Just try to get the situation as much\r\nbetter as possible. This is a technical interview; they don’t expect you to have\r\nexceptional soft skills.\r\n No issue if you can’t answer all the questions, just say no quickly if you don’t know the\r\nanswer. So that you will get a chance to answer more questions.\r\n Try to give a real picture of you. If it is a lie, then the interviewers will find out easily\r\nand it will give a bad impression on you.\r\n Start your core project as early as possible so that you can have much time to do it\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n",

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\nnan\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\nFor your resume to get shortlisted by Citibank you need to have some\r\nproject, or an internship related to finance. When I say finance, it could\r\nbe some project on Fundamental Analysis of Companies, Market\r\nAnalysis, Mergers and Acquisitions, Fund and Risk Management etc.\r\nIn the GD round, everyone who had the bare minimum knowledge\r\nabout the sector were shortlisted. It is best if you speak about the\r\neconomic and financial side of things because it leaves a good\r\nimpression.\r\nIn my first round of Interview, I was asked what exactly an Investment\r\nBanker does and why I want to pursue a career in Investment Banking.\r\nI was then asked a few questions on the project “Mergers and\r\nAcquisitions” offered by Finance and Analytics club. The interviewer\r\nasked me if I knew any recent M&amp;A’s and what were its implications.\r\nThen he proceeded to ask me a hypothetical scenario where Jio\r\nacquires BSNL. Although I had answered some possible “synergies”\r\npossible, they were mainly judging my thought process and how I was\r\nable to arrive at a conclusion.I was then called for my second round of Interview. This round was a bit more technical. The interviewer asked me if I knew the 3 financial\r\nstatements required to analyze a company. He then asked me a few\r\nquestions about the project “Markowitz Portfolio Management”. Then he\r\ntook up the topic of M&amp;A’s and asked me how I went about doing the\r\nproject. He saw that I had highlighted “DCF Valuation” on my resume\r\nand to test my concepts as well as knowledge on macroeconomics, he\r\nasked “How will the investors of a company react if the RBI increases\r\nthe repurchase rate? Could you explain it using DCF valuation?” This\r\nquestion was a bit difficult, but the interviewer guided me, and I gave a\r\nsatisfactory answer.\r\nThe final HR round was a mere formality and asked me questions on\r\nwhy Investment Banking, and what are my strengths etc. No one was\r\nrejected in the HR round.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nBe crystal clear on the projects you have done. Read up on Macroeconomics a week or two\r\nbefore Citibank arrives for recruitment. If you wish to study M&amp;A, use the book by Donald M\r\nDepamphilis.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nDo not keep Finance as your first option without exploring other options. Make sure you have\r\nexplored all the other options and then decided on finance. Since the number of companies\r\nrecruiting for finance roles are very less, please be sure to have a backup option.\r\n\r\n",

Advanced DSA is not\r\nrequired and just basic coding practice and thinking skills are enough to\r\ncrack the question. Next, we get a few questions from Probability and\r\nStatistics. This is an important part of the whole selection procedure.\r\nPrepare well for this, preferred courses to undertake are\r\nMSO201/HSO201. These courses help in building the basic foundations\r\nrequired to solve the problems. If you have not done these courses, you\r\ncan just study the resources related to it and it would be enough. I\r\nwould suggest solving some mental ability questions from Brainstellar,\r\nthese would help develop the insight needed. In the interview round, I\r\nwas given a problem statement regarding a probability question that\r\nhad a subjective answer, I answered the first part correctly, and the\r\ninterviewer then proceeded to ask different varieties of question on the\r\nsame problem statement. After that I was given another problem that\r\nwas an advanced version of the same problem statement, involving\r\nJoint Probability Distribution, I thought about a minute or two and then\r\nproceeded to elaborate my answer and the thought process behind it.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the complete answer is not the correctness\r\nof your solution, but the thought process behind it and how do you\r\ncorrect yourself upon getting guidance and some hints from the\r\ninterviewer. Then the interviewer proceeded to ask some questions\r\nsimilar to HR Rounds and the interview ended.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nMSO201 / HSO201\r\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/\r\nhttps://brainstellar.com/puzzles/\r\nSPO Internship Guide\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nDo not panic in the interview if you are not able to answer the problem statement correctly,\r\njust follow the hints given by the interviewer and explain your thought process behind the\r\nproblem. Try to be technical while answering and compose yourself well. Overall, the\r\ninterview process is interesting and easy if you are confident and have fundamental\r\nknowledge of Probability and Statistics.\r\n\r\n",

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\n Google , Goldman Sachs\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\nAlphagrep -\r\nI was asked OOPS questions, data structure questions and some coding questions in both rounds. Have to code it , interviewer see approach and code is not runned on test cases( common for all interviews).\r\nI have one round of interview followed by another round without break , both of nearly 40 min and then HR round of 5 min, and on spot offer was made.\r\nGoogle -\r\nFormat of google interview is same every year . Only Coding questions are asked in it. Easy version of problem followed by hard version of it. Two rounds of interview and same form.at for each round . Have to code in google doc :|  . Graph and DP are favorite topics of google , and questions of it was asked from my friends and seniors also told that . I was asked array question and greedy question.\r\n\r\nGeneral interview tips -\r\nConvey what you are thinking to interviewer clearly while solving problem . Don't be silent for more than 5 minutes. Also , interviewer gives hint if you are on wrong path or stuck at some point , take it. Be confident.\r\n\r\nI was not asked resume in any interview , but from some , resume was asked in nearly every interview . Be thoroughly prepared with your resume.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nFor Software -\r\nSince , I had already done ESO207 and was also active in CP , I already know the theory part and algorithms commonly used. \r\nDP, graph, trees are extra things( and most important ones) from ESC101 which may be new to you if you haven't done ESO207.\r\nSources for these topics , which I personally found nice\r\nDP - topcoder blog\r\nTrees - ESO207 slides\r\nGraph - ESO207 slides, Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani(chapter on graph)\r\n\r\nI solved interviewbit and recommend it to fully solve it .If you do it regularly for two months , it is not a big deal.\r\n\r\nStudy OOPS from geeks for geeks , will not take much time , can do it summer last\r\n\r\nFor quant -\r\nProbablilty - For theory , any probability course fine which teaches expectation , conditional probability, bayes theorem , etc. . I did CS203\r\nQuestions - Brainstellar, 50 Challenging problems ( some tests and interview have direct questions from here . Very difficult to solve them in given time constraint if you haven't seen them before)\r\nPuzzles - Brainstellar\r\nThese things also didn't take much time ,5-6 days more than enough . can do it in summer last.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nShortlisting for tests is based on CPI .\r\nFor day 1. If you are 9+ , then you'll be able to give nearly every company's test. Try to reach 9+ before summers. At 8.5+ too , eligible to give tests for large number of companies.\r\n\r\nAs intern season progress , CPI bar is lowered by companies and branch restrictions are also relaxed.\r\n\r\nIf targeting software/quant profile , start with coding from start of summers and be regular.\r\nInitially focus on coding . Quant specific prep and other things don't take much time and can do it at end of summers( 10 days before starting of intern season).\r\nTo clear tests  , coding skills is the only key . Improve it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nCPI and coding are things which matters most( maybe things which only matters for most companies).\r\n\r\n",

They are just 4-5 yrs older than you, so call them by their name and always ask about the interviewer at the end of the interview like what was the first project He/She did in that company? \r\n4- Go through some frequent interview questions and answers on gfg, prepbytes,etc. 5- Before any company's interview try to go through the previous year questions of same \r\ncompany's interviews which are available under gfg interview experience tab. \r\n\r\n",

The coding test that followed had a time limit of one hour\r\nand contained questions on topics such as tree traversal and Dynamic\r\nProgramming (DP). Additionally, the quantitative aptitude test included\r\nquestions on probability and discrete mathematics, with a focus on\r\nevaluating probability using recursion, expected values, and Bayes&#39;\r\ntheorem.\r\nThe first round of interview involved coding problems. They asked\r\nquestions from query data structure and tree operations. The second\r\nround of the interview focused on topics from CS220 (Computer\r\nOrganization) such as pipelining, memory management, and stack\r\nmanipulation. Overall, the selection process for the software profile was\r\nrigorous, and candidates were expected to have a solid understanding\r\nof both theoretical and practical concepts related to the field.\r\n\r\nSample Interview\r\n/Test Questions\r\n\r\n1. A variant of k-sum paths in a binary tree – find number of paths in a\r\nbinary tree that has sum k.\r\n2. Find kth largest number in a nxn matrix where each row and column\r\nis sorted in ascending order.\r\n3.

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\nGraviton (Quant), Microsoft (Software)\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\n1. D. E. Shaw - There was a technical test with 3 coding questions based on maths and dynamic programming. In the first round of technical interview, I was asked a problem based on map and prefix sums, and difference between unordered and ordered maps and their implementations. Since I didn't have knowledge regarding computer networks, the interviewer asked me questions based on Object-oriented programming (function overriding/overloading and inheritance). The second round involved standard problems based on trees and two pointers. Here too, Object-oriented programming was discussed. I was questioned about my projects as well in both rounds. \r\n2. Graviton - The technical test for quant role had 4 subjective questions based on probability, bitwise xor and functions. The technical interview comprised two different strategy-based problems, one of them involved several cases of egg-dropping problem with constraints on number of eggs and floors. There were some mental maths questions too.\r\n3. Microsoft - There were 2 coding questions in the test. In one, we were supposed to find triplets of collinear points and the other involved basic maths. There were two technical interview rounds with one basic coding question in each of them. In the first, I was supposed to find minimum element in stack in constant time and in the second, I had to find root node of a tree, given its parent-child relations. There was a rigorous discussion on my resume as well.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nI began my intern prep at the start of summer vacation.\r\nFor software role preparation, I had finished all the topics on interviewbit. I practiced some questions based on dynamic programming and graphs from leetcode and cses. Also, I frequently gave contests on codeforces in the first half of my vacation. I watched some videos from Striver's dynamic programming playlist as well. \r\nFor quant role preparation, I revised the concepts from CS203 lecture notes and completed puzzles from Brainstellar and the 50 challenging problems book. I had gone through the book Xinfeng Zhou as well.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\n1. Utilize your vacation time effectively. The 2-3 month period is sufficient for decent preparation.\r\n2. If aiming for software roles, try your best to give coding contests on codeforces and codechef on a regular basis as it would enhance your problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\n",

The interviewer can pick up any single line from the CV and grill you on it. Apart from this, you will be asked a few technical questions. Mostly, you will be offered a choice of your favourite course, and then they’ll ask you questions from that. Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics are the courses that are generally asked. Don’t dive too deep into the subject, because they aren’t going to test you on mathematical formulae. Just be clear with the basic concepts. Important topics include pumps, motors, generators, thermodynamic cycles, laws of thermodynamics, basic equations of Fluid Mechanics and the likes of these. \r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nHUL and ITC interviews primarily grill you on each and every point of your resume, so be thorough with every single word. You will be asked questions on your projects, PORs, and internships, if you have any. \r\n\r\nBoth HUL and ITC have a resume-based form, which they use for shortlisting. After that-\r\n\r\n1. ITC has a GD round. Read up on the basic etiquette on how you should conduct yourself in the GD. Practice the AnC GDs and you should be good. \r\n\r\n2. HUL has an online video interview round, on the HireVue platform. You basically will be asked around 3 questions, which will be short case studies of sorts, with a set time limit for each, and you need to record yourself while speaking the answer and submit it. You get one attempt per question. For this, you can prepare by reading up on what supply chain actually is, what are the challenges faced in the supply chain and FMCG industry, and what are the best practices to be adopted to improve the industry. You can also read up on the different technologies used in supply chain. \r\n\r\nAfter these rounds, the final shortlist for the interviews is released, wherein you will be asked resume-based, as well as technical questions. \r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nJust be confident, and extremely thorough with your preparation, especially the CV.

At the end he gave me a problem to design a lift in a building using class.\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs- In round 1 I was asked standard problems on probability and statistics like find the expected number of rolls of a dice to see all 6 faces and same for a coin.\r\nAn ant is moving on the edges of a unit square find the expected number of steps to reach the opposite end.\r\nIn round 2 I was given a problem where 10 billion points were to be stored using only 100,000 available spaces dynamically. I was asked to write an algorithm such that at the end the probability to store each point becomes equal \r\nRound 3 was based on my resume, projects and DSA problems.I was asked to suggest a data structure which could reduce the time complexity to send connection request on LinkedIn. And an algorithm to find friends of friends in minimum time possible.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nIn my prephase preparation I have multiple contests over codeforces from January to May hence I was pretty good at topics like arrays and strings so I didn't covered it from interview bit.\r\nI have rigorously followed Interview bit for the start of my preparation. Covered topics like trees, linked list, heaps and maps, stacks and queues completely from there.\r\nPracticed important topics like D.P and graphs from leetcode and CSES. For covering all the standard problems of graphs CSES is the best website I have found \r\n\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nPrepare well before the intern season. Decide your field and use these 2 months to prepare well. Talk to seniors, utilise your time and be focused only on the sectors you want to focus on. Most importantly keep faith in yourself.\r\n\r\n",

The coding test includes one question, typically based on a brute force approach but requires you to analyse all the edge cases very well.\r\nThe interview comprised of one question based on string-matching, and then all your resume projects were thoroughly gone through. Then, there was an HR Round which mainly contained questions like your motivation to join Samsung or to come to Korea.\r\n\r\nOptiver:\r\nIt has two rounds of Technical tests which test your mental ability, quick maths and verbal reasoning. Then for the Quant role, the shortlisted students have the Group Discussion having a few games related to market making and strategy. Then there are final interviews with HR and Technical rounds. The main focus is on your quick maths and mental ability.\r\n\r\nQuadeye:\r\nThe shortlist criteria are CPI>=9. There are direct interviews where they test you on probability and strategy for the quant roles and DSA Concepts and OOPs for the Systems Role.\r\n\r\nDE Shaw:\r\nThe technical test comprised three coding questions based mainly on Maths and DP. Then, the interviews had two technical rounds. The questions were based on heaps, linked lists and queues. Then, there were questions on different concepts of OOPs like encapsulation, virtual function, etc.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nI began the preparation for the intern season at the start of the summer vacation.\r\nFor software roles, you should be proficient with DSA, with can be done through GFG or lecture notes of ESO207. After that, you can start practising questions from InterviewBit and LeetCode. Additionally, regularly giving contests on Codeforces and CodeChef is a plus.\r\nFor the quant part, the basic concepts of probability could be covered from CS203 lecture notes and then questions can be practised from BrainStellar and 50 Challenging Problems in Probability.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nUtilise your vacation well in covering the topics related to DSA if aiming for a software role and the probability of seeking the quant ones.\r\nSoftware roles generally require a decent practice of Competitive Programming on various platforms like Codeforces and going through topic-wise questions of InterviewBit or LeetCode.\r\nAlso, emphasis is put on your knowledge about OOPs, so learn about its basic terms and operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Here are some brief\r\ninsights of his.\r\n\r\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Insights on the Selection Process\r\nI had two technical rounds and one HR round. In first technical round I was asked question on stack, tree and graphs. In second technical round I was asked about my team, which is Team humanoid,  it's project, it's working and questions on implementation of stack using linked list. Also I was asked about my favourite platform to which I answered linkedIn, then a follow up question about it's implementation and further questions on that. I was also asked about database and sql to which I replied: I don't know. In HR round I was the below questions:\r\n1. Why do you applied for eightflod.ai?\r\n2. What do you liked about the firm?\r\n3. Do you know about the recent developments about the company?\r\n4. You are not from computer science background, why should we hire you?\r\n\r\nAll rounds were around 50 mins with 10-15mins break in between them, I tried to engage the interviewer as long as I can.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nI started doing DSA when my summer term just began. I used only InterviewBit to practice DSA questions, followed Aditya Verma's Recursion and Dynamic Programming playlist to get used to thinking while solving questions of the respective topics. And read geeks for geeks articles to get used to the further concepts and to clear any doubts. I consulted resources from some seniors too for specific topics and that helped me a lot. Asked doubts to my friends.\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nMy advice would be to start little early, I started late. Students who start their preparation early are more likely to get good hold over the concepts of DSA. Don't get bogged down by the previous year intern stats of your branch, if you have the required skills you will be definitely getting an internship. Have faith in yourself, that's the most important thing in the whole process. It's important that you don't talk gibberish if you don't know a particular thing, just say I don't know. Talk to as many seniors you want, that will help you in getting a broader perspective about the particular roles you are targeting. \r\n\r\n",

They asked me if it’s front-end or back-end for code written about car, and what’s the difference between.Like mostly DBMS.\r\nAs for HR\r\nThey asked me a lot of teamwork related questions and asked me why am I passionate about coding like what me attracted to it since I told them so many passionate things about coding/software.\r\nThey asked me about python and what would you use python for? And why C++? Differentiate them.\r\nWhy choose JLR?\r\nThey asked me about some DBMS I don’t know and even OOP’s.I simply answered them that I didn’t come across this question nor did I cover OOPs in my curriculum.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\nGfg,interviewbit and study about which language you are going for details a lot like for C++ do read about namespace, source value and time stuff related\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nBe cool and confident in interview and do your DSA well and thorough.Do study about DBMS and if they ask some questions you don’t know, just tell them you didn’t cover it yet.Don’t sugarcoat in interview, be honest about your resume. Be more passionate and give appropriate HR answers and make the company itself and yourself stand out during your speech like what makes this company different from other companies.If you do that, they will eventually start to like you and ask you more questions.\r\nDo quite a research about company and what makes them special and different so that it will help you in interview and find some interesting to ask at the end of interview to prove that you are interested and did a research about this company.\r\nAt the end of interview, I asked them about JLR and NVIDIA collaboration since NVIDIA is providing automation test to JLR by 2023, so I asked what will SDE do then if NVIDIA is aiding?\r\nIt’s okay if you don’t get it, it’s not the end of the world there’s other more companies to try, just never give up :)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Resume Shortlist – Good CPI (8+ mostly but not necessary),\r\nprojects, intern/ research experience is a plus, students with a\r\n3\r\nrd year POR are preferred.\r\n2. 1 Psychometric test and 1 aptitude test.

MCQs about 15 in number consisted of C++ questions and DSA\r\nQuestions. Topics covered were: OOPs, Virtual Functions,\r\nReference Variables, Smart Pointers, Mutex, etc\r\n2. CODING QUESTIONS\\{2 in number\\}:\r\n-Greedy Approach\r\n-Expected Value was to be found out, but was on a trickier side.\r\nInterview\r\nDuration: 45min to 1hr\r\nInterview Questions:\r\n- The Interview began with a question on Computer\r\n\r\nOrganization, but I had not done the Course CS220, so they\r\nchanged the topics of the questions.\r\n- Asked a DSA Question, which could be solved by greedy\r\napproach after little bit of thinking.\r\n- They further questioned on C++ Concepts, specifically\r\n1.What is the difference between ordered and unordered\r\nmap?\r\n2. How are the clashes resolved in hashing used in\r\nunordered map?\r\n- Reference Variables and Passing by Reference.\r\n- OOPS:\r\nPolymorphism and Inheritance and how C++ Implements it?\r\nVirtual Functions were also touched upon.\r\nInterview Tips:\r\nBe Confident\r\nIf you don’t know about the topics, its better to confess and think\r\non logics. Because, the interviewer wants to see the way you\r\napproach the Question, even if you are unable to get to the\r\nspecific answer.\r\n\r\n##  Preparation Resources\r\n-Learn C through ESC101\r\n-Go through C++ STL and start Competitive Programming as early as possible.\r\n-In Summers,\r\n1.

But, practice makes the\r\ndifference. So, its much important to practice on InterviewBit and LeetCode.\r\nYoutube Playlist for C++:\r\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb\r\n\r\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \r\nDos-\r\nDon’t be late to start\r\nIf one has done basic competitive programming, it would take entire summer to master DSA.\r\n\r\n",

Here are some brief insights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nAssociate Consultant – Bain &amp; CompanyBusiness Analyst – Mckinsey &amp; Company\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nThe interview process for Navi was pretty straight forward. They released an interviewshortlist based on the resumes (for other profiles they conducted tests) and then there werethree rounds of interviews. Despite interviewing a lot of candidates, the company offered jobto only two candidates so, the number of candidates that were able to convert the interviewinto an offer were very low, and this was same for all the profiles for which the company cameto hire. If I can recall correctly around 35-50 students interviewed for the product profile andonly two of them received the offer, the company gave a total of seven offers across all theprofile.From what I could make-up they had a very high expectations from the candidates, they werelooking for someone who had a really strong profile and also the required fundamentals forthe job.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nIITB Casebook, IITM Casebook, SRCC casebook, Victor Cheng YouTube album on casesolving.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n1. Strong Profile: Talk to as much seniors as possible, try to understand what thecompanies that you are targeting are looking for in the candidates and ideally yourresume should check all those boxes. (Like in case of consulting and productcompanies look for candidates with good academic records, internships, extra-curricular achievements, Position of responsibility etc.).2. Resume: Making resume is an iterative process and you should never stop workingon it till the date of submission comes. Resumes are what you can consider your firstimpression in front of the recruiters, so its only fair that you invest a decent amount oftime on it.Identify seniors and alums that are working in the companies that you are targetingand try to get multiple reviews from them. A good way to do this is uploading multiplecopies of a single draft of resume on google drive and sending each copy to aparticular senior and they can give you specific review by using the comment features.3. Interview preparation: After securing an interview, everything boils down to twothings (i) Your preparations and (ii) Communication Skills.For product and consulting related profiles you should try to form two case prepgroups of three member each. One should have students who you think are startingwith the same level of preparation as you and in the another you should practice withstudent who are a little ahead in the preparations. There are endless resourcesavailable online so I won’t go into what exactly you should prepare.\n\n",

There were2 rounds of interviews. First one was purely technical, 2 people in panel - One was thefounder and other was Associate Consultant. I was asked a Brainstellar puzzle, somequestions on python (my preferred language) and finance questions related to projects on myresume which mainly included Accounting & options. Besides that, they also asked aboutwhat the company does and surprisingly no candidate was able to answer this question fully. Iattended the pre placement talk and hence was able to answer, the interviewers were quitehappy (minor thing but got bonus points). Second round was more of an HR round where mypanel consisted of 8 people expecting you to get intimidated. They mainly talked about somequestions based on my resume, making situations out of it. Also, I was questioned about myadaptability if I had to code since I was more interested in Finance & Consulting.

Stick to limited resources and do them honestly.● Being a non-coder, it doesn't harm revisiting the basics and practicing problems beforeplacements, it helped me a lot. Do not completely ignore coding, it will always help!● Try to apply to maximum companies that come, interview experiences are valuableand will make you ready for the D-Day.\n\n",

First Round: 1 st round was based on solving DSA problems. The interviewer asked forfavorite data structures. Then the interviewer focused on the responded datastructures and grilled on them going from easy question to medium questions.2. Second Round: This round was based on System Design concepts and OOPS. Theinterview revolved around devising a system design for a Vending Machine.HR Interview:This interview revolved around standard HR questions. It was more of a structuredconversation and culture fitment round.Each of the rounds lasted for 30 minutes for me. Also, some people had an additionalTechnical Interview round between First and Second rounds, which was based on solving CPtype coding problems.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nFollowing preparation resources can come in handy for SDE profile: DSA and problem solving from Leetcode, InterviewBit, Codeforces, etc. Striver’s A-Z &amp; SDE Sheet: https://takeuforward.org/This is handy if you’re a bit clueless about your preparation and need some structuresapproach for preparing yourself. Puzzles from Brainstellar (https://brainstellar.com/) “Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability” by Frederick Mosteller. “Cracking the Coding Interview” by G.L. McDowell. – Fantastic resource getting aholistic view of coding interview scenarios. “A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews” by Xinfeng Zhou. – Greatresource if you’re targeting Quant profile &amp; HFTs.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \n Have a Peer group: The placement season tends to be overwhelming at times. Besure to talk to your peer group. It helps to discuss things during preparation and aftertests. Also, a close friend acts as a wonderful support system. Have a go-to senior: Placement season imposes a lot of confusions, like, whichprofiles to target, which companies to apply for, whether to accept or reject your PPOoffer, etc. Besides all of this, you need someone to cheer you up and give valuable lastminute advices when you’re hours away from your interview. Understand &amp; Accept your chances: Be sure to realise your potential and not shy offfrom applying to job opportunities. Also, it is always recommended to have a fewbackup options, which you’re confident to crack incase you run out of luck. Build a Self-Story: For getting through culture fitment and HR questions, you just don’tneed a good resume, but a great binding agent to your resume. Have anunderstanding of how your resume reflects your story and mold it appropriatelyaccording to the role and company. Know your recruiter: Thoroughly read the Job Description provided by the company.Read the ‘About Us’ page of the firm. Have a thorough understanding of what are thevalues that your potential employer considers worthy. Fins ways to sneak in these bitsof information in your conversation with the interviewers to reflect your interest in thecompany and profile. Target Wisely: Discuss the profiles and companies that you’re targeting with yourseniors and get a fair understanding of how the firm typically recruits and what do theylook for in the resume, tests and interviews. Hear your Interviewer: Hear what the interview speaks of themselves in the interview.This helps greatly in asking out questions at the end of the interview and also whileformulating your answers during the interview.\n\n",

Set thetimer(initially it’ll be hard to complete it on time) and try to solve that within the set time. Afteryou are done with your case , read the solution and write the things which you missed outwhich could have made your solution better.

Here are some brief insights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nGlean – SoftwareMckinsey – Bussiness Analyst\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nConsulting interview process revolves a lot around how well you are able to solve a case.Don;t need to solve it explicitly, rather the process is what matters. Along with thiscommunication is absolute key. If you are not able to explain your thinking to the interviewerright now, or answer his/her question properly, how will you do this in front of a client.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nFor case interviews, I used Case Interviews Cracked, SRCC Case Compedium and IIMACaseBook. Majorly 4 types of cases you need to practise well. Guesstimates are equallyimportant.Make good answers for the questions usually asked.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nFirst and foremost : Decide what role you would want to explore for the next 2-3 years of yourlife. Don’t thing about this decision as life changing. You are just 22. Even if you go forsomething you feel you like right now, but don’t actually later, there will be inumerableopportunities to move into something you find more intereting.Currently I feel consulting will be a very nice learning curve for me, but I am not taking it as aline of truth, that I am going to build my entire 30 year career out of this. Once you work atyour recent job, you will realize what work you would like more.Second : Don’t ever get anxious by how sorted somebody else looks. Primarily for tworeasons : If they are genuinely then it’s great, but you aren’t and that’s completely fine;Second, most aren’t they just present themselves as such to not showcase confusion.Later Do’s : Start early. Don’t try to fool yourself. Prepare honestly. It will take a lot of time,good feedback, hardwork, focus to get better at things. Don’t look at people who are alreadygood at the things you are trying to get good at. They have put in a lot of effort which you justcan’t see.Do’s : Always make a group to prepare and keep motivating each other. Preparing alone isvery difficult, although not impossible.Do’s : Never ever hesitate to reach out for help.Dont’s : Think of anything : “Ki ho jayega”. You don’t what you’re taking so lightly right now,will be so crucial in landing your preferred job.Dont’s : Let go of your academics for preparing. It will just add to the pressure. It also acts asa different area for you to focus on, and can help in breaking the monotony.\n\n",

Then the technical test was also based on Full-stack development, itconsists of two question on backend (we had to write some code to receive some data fromtheir database, and the other I don’t remember), two questions on frontend (we had todevelop a phonebook, and a button which toggles on click), and one coding question (codingquestion level was Leetcode easy).The interview round was mainly to check our communication skills, how we are thinking at themoment, and our confidence. It lasted around 30-40 minutes.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nFor coding, first I read the topics from gfg and practice some basic questions on the topic fromthere (Basic and Intermediate). Then I solved the Interview bit for further practice, as it coversquestions asked in interviews. And finally, I solved problems on Leetcode for more practice onsome difficult questions for technical test.For preparations of HR round, we can find some standard questions on gfg and also theiranswers. But according to me we should not give the same answers as found from sources, itshould be purely based on our thoughts, we can just use the resources to know whatquestions are being asked.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nFor preparing the technical test, it is of utmost importance that we give coding contestsregularly. We can find weekly and bi-weekly contests on Leetcode, interviewbit, codechef andcodeforces. But majority of the tests in placements, which I gave, were based on the patternof leetcode coding contest, so we should not miss them, and should solve them regularly onfirst priority.\n\n",

Here are some brief insights of his.\n\n## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:\nWorldquant(Quant Researcher), Quantbox (QuantResearcher and Developer), Squarepoint(Developer), JPMC(Software), Kivi Capital(Quant),Morgan Stanley(Quant) on Day 1.\n\n## Insights on the Selection Process\nA representative from HR and from the technical team was present on the virtual call (Zoom).Once they give you a technical question, you are given 30 seconds to a minute to come upwith the solution or your approach. They ask you to think aloud to get to know the thoughtprocess. The Interview also involved standard HR questions, Why quant, why Da Vinci, etc.Another HR question was to describe a project that inspired you the most and the conditionsyou overcame. There was only one round and lasted around 45 mins.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nFor Quants - 50 Challenging problems in Probability, Cut the knot: Probability Riddles,brainstellar.com, A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews by Xinfeng Zhou andMSO201 slides.For Coding - leetcode, InterviewBit and CodingNinjas. Try to cover the breadth first.\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nPlacement shortlists do involve a bit of luck, so don’t be disheartened if you are not initiallyshortlisted. Try to do previous year or company-specific questions as they are sometimesrepeated. In hindsight, I’d suggest starting the prep as early as possible. Even if you aretargeting other profiles, try to do a bit of coding. Lastly, a good group while preparing willdefinitely help.\n\n",

Projects from resumes werealso discussed.Fourth Round- HR round.\n\n##  Preparation Resources\nFor the Coding partI did leetcode and interviewbit.- Some standard data structures and algorithms are like the vocabulary of English. Youhave to know some of them to be able to write code. So start with some standardalgorithms. You can refer to some youtube channels like codencode for graphs, adityaverma for DP, and recursion.- Don’t worry if you are not able to solve everything by yourself from the start. Try toidentify the patterns. For this, a very good resource is leetcode studyplans(https://leetcode.com/study-plan/). Questions are grouped according to thesimilarity of concepts. Even if some of the study plans are paid, you can look for thequestions on GitHub.- Give regular contests on any of the coding sites. I used leetcode for this. This will helpyou to apply what you have learned and will improve your speed too.For puzzles and probability part:- Revise MSO201 or any other probability course from your department.- Do puzzles from the book Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews ByXinfeng Zhou. You can easily find the pdf.- Brainstellar puzzles.- 50 challenging problems in probability\n\n## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? \nStart early and try to solve some questions every day. There is a daily question featureon leetcode and gfg.- Mark the questions and concepts on which you struggled. I made an Excel sheet forthis. Revise them after some days or before a test/interview.- Shortlist 2-3 profiles and prepare for them only. Don’t run after every company andprofile.- Make a small group of people to prepare with. Preparing in a group is always better asyou can discuss doubts. Healthy competition always encourages you to performbetter.- Don’t hesitate to contact seniors. It does not matter whether you know that senior ornot. Just text them with your doubts. You can contact me also.\n\n",

Do not worry about resource X beingmarginally better than resource Y. I wasted too much time worrying about what book/resourceto follow. It is all the same. Just make sure you run through whatever source you follow by thetime the interviews start. Holds true for all profiles.It is a great idea to be a part of a small group (~4) of people who are preparing for the sameprofile as you. Really helps in tracking progress. I did not do this and clearly suffered.Please enroll in some MCQ test series to get a taste of the actual setting. The questions aremostly easy but getting a lot of them right needs practice.Surround yourself with supportive people when the interviews start. Let them handle phonecalls and interview call-ups. You can and should focus on running through your resume-related answers and other such things.Don’t get scared about chatter like company X not coming for placements, company Y onlydoing binary hiring…none of it matters by the time placements start. There are more thanenough opportunities for you and your friends. Don’t become a part of the noise and calmyourself and your friends down.
